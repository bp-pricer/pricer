# BP-Pricer

This project is very work in progress. Its supposed to automatically create price suggestions based on backpack.tf listings,
it does so by syncing the listings from the websocket & snapshots into a redis database and then using that data to create price suggestions.

The plan is also to create a web interface for the price suggestions & to visualize the data.
